## :mortar_board: The Idea

Estava pensando em como presentear minha namorada no dia dos namorados, mas n√£o poderia ser qualquer presente. It should be something unique, something that my girlfriend had never done for her, at the same time it should be original, something I would put together.

I'm a developer, why not create a website? - she never received a website. A website can be fun, it's something I know how to do and at the same time I can put my words and my heart, it looks perfect right? - laughs
