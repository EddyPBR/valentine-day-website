<h1 align="center" decoration="none"> VALENTINE'S DAY WEBSITE </h1>
<br />

This project is a website that I created for my girlfriend as part of the Valentine's Day gift for her, I am leaving it public to inspire developers in general to present their girlfriends in such a way. After all, what comes from the heart and is built by your own hands has a much greater meaning.

## :mortar_board: The Idea

I was thinking about how to present my girlfriend on Valentine's Day, but it couldn't be any gift. It should be something unique, something that my girlfriend had never done for her, at the same time it should be original, something I would put together.

I'm a developer, why not create a website? - she never received a website. A website can be fun, it's something I know how to do and at the same time I can put my words and my heart, it looks perfect right? - laughs
